Testcases that should be implemented using JEST-

1)Buttons are clickable or not
2)On clicking the individual dates the modal is popping out or not
3)The cancel button on the modal is working or not
4)writing an note is working or not
5)saving a note is working or not
6) saving a note anywhere on the calendar is working or not
7)webpage layout is properly visible or not

Reason for implementation-

The above testcases need to be validated for the application to render and work properly
on different devices.
